# dstack compose file for TDX oracle deployment.

# The SHA256 of this file becomes the compose-hash, extended into RTMR[3].
# Any change to this file (including image digest) produces a different RTMR[3],
# which must be registered on-chain via setRtmr3().
#
# bots.json is runtime-mounted (NOT part of measurement).
# config.yaml is baked into the image (IS part of measurement).
